# Project_textTospeech
This Python script uses pyttsx3 for text-to-speech and SpeechRecognition to convert voice to text. It first speaks “Hello Karan,” then listens through the microphone and prints the spoken words. Error handling ensures the app responds if audio isn’t clear or if there’s no internet for speech recognition.
